		<h3>ABOUT THE PASTRY CHEF</h3>
			<p>Pastry Chef/Owner Chloe Guedalia was born and raised in our small town of West New Loughton. One could even say this is her second bakery on Main Street, as she spent most summers having bakesales in the park at the interection of Main and Hamilton. Chloe started baking at six years old, mixing batter while her mother set the oven. As she grew up and tried more complicated recipes, pastry became her passion and she decided to go into it professionally.</p>
			<p>Chloe studied at the Culinary Institute of America, taking her externship at the world famous Panella bakery in Rome, Italy. She graduated with a degree in Baking, Pastry and Business management. She then returned to italy to get a Masters in Italian Cuisine at the headquarters of the Italian Culinary Institute for Foreigners in Costigliole d'Asti, Italy. Armed with her  new found knowledge, Chloe returned to her home town to start her own pastry shop.</p>
			<p>Chloe loves making new and interesting pastries to delight her customers. She also enjoys a challenge and, in order to keep her customers coming back, creates new pastries every month using seasonal fruits and vegitables. Chloe never makes the same thing twice, so come down and get <a href="http://chloethalia.github.io/unit_9/june.html">this months pastries</a> before they're gone. </p>
